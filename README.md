## Development server

  Use `npm` to install dependencies. Do not run `yarn install` since it may disregard the dependency order and raise compatibility problems about `ng-zorro-antd` and `less`.

Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
